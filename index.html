    <h1>Confidence Interval Simulation</h1>
    <h2>THE FIRST DRAFT OF THIS PAGE IS COMPLETE AND READY FOR FEEDBACK</H2>
    <p>Confidence intervals are one way to use
        statistics from a sample to make estimates about a population.
        If a parameter's <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sampling-distribution.asp" target="_blank">sampling distribution</a> is well-understood, the
        probabilities behind that distribution can be algebraically reversed to
        estimate the parameter's value using sample data.</p>
    <p>For this activity, we're going to simulate taking samples of dice rolls
        and using the data from each sample to estimate the true mean dice roll
        (which we can compute directly using probability).</p>
    <p>To get started, complete the form below.

        <h2>Population Parameters</h2>

        <p>Since we understand the probabilities behind dice rolling, we can directly
            calculate the mean and standard deviation of the population of all dice rolls,
            anywhere in the universe, thoughout all time.

        <h2>Sample(s) Statistics</h2>
        <p>Below is a graph of individual dice rolls. These
            are the combined results from all of the samples in your simulation.
 <ol>
                <li>What do you notice about the distribution of rolls?</li>
                <li>What might explain that?</li>
                <li>How is "natural variation" reflected in this graph?</li>

                   </p>
        <p>We also have a graph of sample means (ie. the mean of each sample) from the simulation. The true population
            mean is marked with a dotted line.
             <ol>
                <li>How does the distribution of sample means compare to the previous graph?</li>
                <li>When looking at the shape of this distribution, what are you reminded of?</li>
                <li>Research the sampling distribution for sample mean. Why do you think the sample means
                    in this graph are clustered around the population mean?</li>
                <li>Based on what you know, how likely is it that you would naturally get a sample with a mean of 1.3?</li>

        <h2>Confidence Intervals</h2>
        <p>Pick a sample mean on the outer edges of the previous graph and another sample mean closer to the center. Which do you 
		think provides a better estimate of the true population mean, and why?</p>
		<p>In real-world studies we don't know the population mean, and we usually only have one sample to reference (instead 
		of thousands). Put yourself in that position: you only have one of the above samples, and you don't know the population 
		mean. Can you determine</p>
            <ol>
                <li> How close you are to the population mean?
                <li> How representative your sample is of the larger population?
            </ol>
		<p> Confidence intervals provide an estimate for population mean (or other parameter) while accounting for the fact 
		that some samples provide better estimates than others. Using the probabilities of a sampling distribution, they work 
		backwards from a particular sample to estimate the different population means that could have plausibly produced that sample. 
		For example, how many samples in the above graph had a mean of 1.3? We can turn that reasoning around: if our dice rolling 
		produced a sample with a mean of 1.3, could the population mean plausibly be 3.4?</p>
        <p>You can learn how to calculate confidence intervals <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/confidence-intervals-one-sample" target="_blank">here</a>, though most people <a href="https://www.calculator.net/confidence-interval-calculator.html" target="_blank">use technology</a> to find the interval itself. 
		Any value in a sample's confidence interval is an equally plausible estimate for the population mean. We hope
		that the true population mean is in the interval (ie. we have a representative sample), but there's really no way of knowing.</p>
		<p>We control this uncertainty by attaching a "confidence level" to the estimate. Most studies use 95% or 99% confidence 
		(or the equivalent), but any confidence level is technically possible. To understand how confidence works, let's look at the 
		samples you generated</p>
		<p>You generated <span id="sizeinfo"></span> dice rolling samples. For each sample, we constructed a <span id="confinfo"></span> 
		confidence interval, and checked to see if it contained &mu;=<span id="muinfo"></span>. You can scroll through the results below.</p>
        <textarea id="resultbox" rows="10" cols="73"></textarea>
		
		<p>All in all, <span id="intinfo"></span> samples resulted in a confidence interval that contained &mu;. Feel free To
		scroll up and repeat this experiment multiple times for different sample sizes, number of samples and confidence levels.</p>
		<ol>
		<li>In your experiments, how did confidence affect the proportion of samples resulting in an interval containing &mu;?
		<li>How does confidence account for the fact that some samples are more representative than others?
		<li>Outside of generating thousands of samples, do we have a way of knowing how representative a single sample is?
		</ol>

        <p>The natural temptation is to go to 99% or higher confidence, but that comes with tradeoffs. Click the button
            to run one more sample.</p>
        <button onclick="singleSample()">One more sample</button><br />
    </div>


    <div id="confexperiment" style="display:none">
        <textarea id="confexsample" rows="5" cols="73"></textarea>
        <p>Let's look at a 90%, 95%, 98% and 99% confidence interval for this sample.</p>
        <div id="confgraph" style="width:100%;max-width:600px"></div>
        <p>The graph above shows you both the sample mean and the population mean. A confidence interval is "built" around a
            sample's mean, and you want an interval that includes the population mean. If you click the "One more sample" button
            several times, you may get a sample whose 90% confidence interval doesn't contain the population mean. This is the benefit
            of higher confidence.</p>
		<p>However, higher confidence comes at a price. Compare the 99% interval to the 90% interval. Which one tells you more about where the population mean is?</p>
		<p>In science class, you may have learned about accuracy vs precision. Higher confidence provides more accuracy, but at the expense of precision. 
        <h2>The best of both worlds</h2>
        <p>It is possible to get both a high level of confidence and high level of precision, but you need a
            sufficiently large sample. You can experiment using the form below:
        <form>
            <label for="intwidth">Desired Interval Width:</label>
            <input type="number" id="intwidth" name="intwidth" value=".5"><br/>

            <select id="desiredconf" name="desiredconf">
            <option value="90%">90%</option>
            <option value="95%" selected>95%</option>
            <option value="98%">98%</option>

        <p>To demonstrate this, we'll generate a sample of this size and produce a confidence interval from it.</p>
        <textarea id="widthsampleoutput" rows="5" cols="73"></textarea><br/>
        <div id="sizegraph" style="width:100%;max-width:600px"></div>
        <p>If you look at the interval's bounds, you'll find they are approximately the width you requested. Researchers
            use information like this in the planning phases of their research to determine how large a sample they
            need.
